By doing so, you can create AI apps that combine the\nbest of both worlds.\nDuring K evin Scott's talk The era of the AI Copilot , he showed how Microsoft powers its\nCopilot system  with a stack of AI models and plugins. At the center of this stack is an AI\norchestration layer that allows us to combine AI models and plugins together to create\nbrand new experiences for users.\nSemantic Kernel is at the center of the copilot\nstack", "source": "semantic-kernel.pdf"}
{"id": "4ef783079d1f-0", "topic": "Semantic Kernel", "text": "To help developers build their own Copilot experiences on top of AI plugins, we have\nreleased Semantic K ernel, a lightweight open-source SDK that allows you to orchestrate\nAI plugins. With Semantic K ernel, you can leverage the same AI orchestration patterns\nthat power Microsoft 365 Copilot and Bing in your own apps, while still leveraging your\nexisting development skills and investments.\nSemantic K ernel has been engineered to allow developers to flexibly integrate AI\nservices into their existing apps. T o do so, Semantic K ernel provides a set of connectors\nthat make it easy to add memories  and models . In this way, Semantic K ernel is able to\nadd a simulated \"brain\" to your app.\nAdditionally, Semantic K ernel makes it easy to add skills to your applications with AI\nplugins  that allow you to interact with the real world. These plugins are composed of\nprompts  and native functions  that can respond to triggers and perform actions. In this\nway, plugins are like the \"body\" of your AI app.\nBecause of the extensibility Semantic K ernel provides with connectors and plugins , you\ncan use it to orchestrate AI plugins from both OpenAI and Microsoft on top of nearly\nany model. For example, you can use Semantic K ernel to orchestrate plugins built for\nChatGPT, Bing, and Microsoft 365 Copilot on top of models from OpenAI, Azure, or even\nHugging F ace.\uea80 Tip\nIf you are interested in seeing a sample of the copilot stack in action (with Semantic\nKernel at the center of it), check out Project Miyagi .

For example, if you\njust need an abstraction over OpenAI and Azure OpenAI services, you could use the SDK\nto just run pre-configured prompts within your plugins, but the real power of Semantic\nKernel comes from combining these components together.\nIf you wanted, you could use the APIs for popular AI services directly and directly feed\nthe results into your existing apps and services. This, however, requires you to learn the\nAPIs for each service and then integrate them into your app. Using the APIs directly also\ndoes not allow you to easily draw from the recent advances in AI research that require\nsolutions on top of these services. For example, the existing APIs do not provide\nplanning or AI memories out-of-the-box.Why do you need an AI orchestration SDK?", "source": "semantic-kernel.pdf"}

Semantic K ernel is Microsoft's contribution to this space and is designed to\nsupport enterprise app developers who want to integrate AI into their existing apps.\nBy using multiple AI models, plugins, and memory all together within Semantic K ernel,\nyou can create sophisticated pipelines that allow AI to automate complex tasks for users.\nFor example, with Semantic K ernel, you could create a pipeline that helps a user send an\nemail to their marketing team. With memory , you could retrieve information about the\nproject and then use planner  to autogenerate the remaining steps using available\nplugins (e.g., ground the user's ask with Microsoft Graph data, generate a response with\nGPT-4, and send the email). Finally, you can display a success message back to your user\nin your app using a custom plugin.\nStep Component Descr iption\n1 Ask It starts with a goal being sent to Semantic K ernel by either a user or\ndeveloper.\n2 Kernel The kernel  orchestrates a user's ask. T o do so, the kernel runs a pipeline /\nchain  that is defined by a developer. While the chain is run, a common\ncontext is provided by the kernel so data can be shared between functions.\n2.1 Memories With a specialized plugin, a developer can recall and store context in\nvector databases. This allows developers to simulate memory  within their\nAI apps.\n2.2 Planner Developers can ask Semantic K ernel to auto create chains to address novel\nneeds for a user.

This standard, which is called a ChatGPT plugin in this\narticle, uses a plugin manifest file that points to an accompanying OpenAPI\nspecification . Plugins defined in this way can then be used by any application that\nsupports the OpenAI specification, including Semantic K ernel and ChatGPT.\nSo far, however, we've only shown how to create plugins that are nativ ely loaded into\nSemantic K ernel instead of being exposed through an OpenAPI specification. This has\nhelped us demonstrate the core concepts of plugins without adding the additional\ncomplexity of standing up an HT TP endpoint. With minimal changes, however, we can\ntake the plugins we've already created and expose them to ChatGPT.\nThere are three steps we must take to turn our existing MathPlugin into a ChatGPT\nplugin:\n1. Create HT TP endpoints for each native function.\n2. Create an OpenAPI specification and plugin manifest file that describes our plugin.\n3. Test the plugin in either Semantic K ernel or ChatGPT.What are ChatGPT plugins?\n\uff09 Impor tant\nOpenAPI is different than OpenAI.

They serve as inputs or queries that users can provide to\nelicit specific responses from a model.\nEffective prompt design is essential to achieving desired outcomes with LLM AI models.\nPrompt engineering, also known as prompt design, is an emerging field that requires\ncreativity and attention to detail. It involves selecting the right words, phrases, symbols,\nand formats that guide the model in generating high-quality and relevant texts.\nIf you've already experimented with ChatGPT, you can see how the model's behavior\nchanges dramatically based on the inputs you provide. For example, the following\nprompts produce very different outputs:\nPrompt\nPrompt\nThe first prompt produces a long report, while the second prompt produces a concise\nresponse. If you were building a UI with limited space, the second prompt would be\nmore suitable for your needs. Further refined behavior can be achieved by adding even\nmore details to the prompt, but its possible to go too far and produce irrelevant\noutputs. As a prompt engineer, you must find the right balance between specificity and\nrelevance.\nWhen you work directly with LLM models, you can also use other controls to influence\nthe model's behavior. For example, you can use the temperature parameter to control\nthe randomness of the model's output. Other parameters like top-k, top-p, frequency\npenalty, and presence penalty also influence the model's behavior.The subtleties of prompting\nPlease give me the history of humans.\nPlease give me the history of humans in 3 sentences.", "source": "semantic-kernel.pdf"}

A good\nprompt engineer can help organizations get the most out of their LLM AI models by\ndesigning prompts that produce the desired outputs.\nSemantic K ernel is a valuable tool for prompt engineering because it allows you to\nexperiment with different prompts and parameters across multiple different models\nusing a common interface. This allows you to quickly compare the outputs of different\nmodels and parameters, and iterate on prompts to achieve the desired results.\nOnce you've become familiar with prompt engineering, you can also use Semantic\nKernel to apply your skills to real-world scenarios. By combining your prompts with\nnative functions and connectors, you can build powerful AI-powered applications.\nLastly, by deeply integrating with Visual S tudio Code, Semantic K ernel also makes it easy\nfor you to integrate prompt engineering into your existing development processes.\nBecoming a skilled prompt engineer requires a combination of technical knowledge,\ncreativity, and experimentation. Here are some tips to excel in prompt engineering:\nUnder stand LLM AI models:  Gain a deep understanding of how LLM AI models\nwork, including their architecture, training processes, and behavior.\nDomain knowledge:  Acquire domain-specific knowledge to design prompts that\nalign with the desired outputs and tasks.\nExperimentation:  Explore different parameters and settings to fine-tune prompts\nand optimize the model's behavior for specific tasks or domains.\nFeedb ack and it eration:  Continuously analyze the outputs generated by the model\nand iterate on prompts based on user feedback to improve their quality and\nrelevance.\nStay updat ed: Keep up with the latest advancements in prompt engineering", "source": "semantic-kernel.pdf"}

Then, you can use a\nlarge language model and pass information from the vector database with your AI\nplugin to generate more informative and engaging content that matches your intent\nand style.\nFor example, if you want to write a blog post about the latest trends in AI, you can use a\nvector database to store the latest information about that topic and pass the\ninformation along with the ask to a LLM in order to generate a blog post that leverages\nthe latest information.\nToday, we have several connectors to vector databases that you can use to store and\nretrieve information.

For\nexample, it's possible to build very general patterns, like \"build a report from a\ndatabase\" or \"teach a year of a subject\" that can be parameterized with plain text\nprompts to produce enormously valuable and differentiated results easily.\n3. Code is for syntax and pr ocess; models ar e for semantics and int ent.

Emerging LLM AI models are incredibly capable and \"well\neducated\" but they lacks context and initiative. If you ask them a simple or open-\nended question, you will get a simple or generic answer back. If you want more\ndetail and refinement, the question has to be more intelligent. This is an echo of\n\"Garbage in, Garbage out\" for the AI age.\n6. Uncer tainty is an ex ception thr ow. Because we are trading precision for leverage,\nwe need to lean on interaction with the user when the model is uncertain about\nintent. Thus, when we have a nested set of prompts in a program, and one of them\nis uncertain in its result (\"One possible way...\") the correct thing to do is the\nequivalent of an \"exception throw\" - propagate that uncertainty up the stack until\na level that can either clarify or interact with the user.\n7.

Since the LLMs are adept at parsing natural\nlanguage and intent as well as semantics, text is a natural format for passing\ninstructions between prompts, modules and LLM based services.
